<h6 id="invoice">Development Summary: (...resources/views/invoice/info/invoice.php)</h6>

<p><b>Aim: To develop a similar invoicing system to InvoicePlane integrating with the latest Jquery, and security features of Yii3 using wampserver
        as a test platform for WAMP and also Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for LAMP.</b>
</p>
<p><b>To Do's - Longer Term Goals</b></p>
<p>1. <s>Integration of Payment Gateways</s>PCI Compliant Stripe, Amazon Pay, Braintree, and Mollie have been introduced.</p>
<p>2. Accountant Role with the ability of an accountant/bookkeeper to record payments against invoices.</p>
<p><s>3. Include a <b>Company Private Detail</b> specific logo on a pdf invoice.</s></p>
<p>4. Acceptance Tests for Invoice</p>
<p>5. Further validation and exceptions to be included in testing of e-Invoicing using PeppolHelper.</p>
<p><s>6. Filters to be introduced on grids</s></p>
<p><s>7. Improve Generator index template using Yiisoft functions.</s></p>
<p><s>8. Include Product images</s></p>
<p>9. Integrate <code>https://github.com/php-finance/double-entry</code></p>
<p>10. Remove all $s variables passed to views since the variable is definded under config/params.php</p>
<p>11. Upskilling on Docker. </p>

<p>Work In Progress - Shorter Term Goals</p>
<p><s>Psalm Level 2 - Testing</s></p>
<p><s>Dead Code Removal with Psalm 3 Testing</s></p>
<p><s>Language array generator using Google Translate</s></p>
<p><s>All invoices with dates falling within CompanyPrivate start and end dates will have the specific logo uploaded</s></p>
<p><s>for this CompanyPrivate record attached to these invoices.</s></p>
<p><s>CompanyPrivate logo will be automatically input on invoice/quotes depending on whether the date of the invoice falls between the start and end date.</s></p>
<p>Introducing Paypal.</p>
<p>Introducing India's PayTm payment gateway's QR code method of payment and comparing this with Stripe's method.</p>
<p>A General Sales Tax (GST) Tax System will have to be implemented first for this purpose.</p>
<p>Testing Credit Notes against Invoices with refunds (if payment made) linked to each of the payment gateways.</p>
<p><b>22nd June 2024</b></p>
<p>1. Include a requirements checker under FAQ's using newish repo 'yiisoft/requirements'.</p>
<p>2. Tested the Generator with a dummy Entity and updated the Generator with a few additional fixes.</p>
<p>3. Included actual ini_get values under the performance section on the main menu.</p>
<p>4. Alphabetical reordering of composer .json. (Except Payment Providers and rossaddison/ temporary
 forks which will be removed later).</p>
<p>5. docker-compose.yml does not require the version number anymore.</p>
<p><b>14th June 2024</b></p>
<p>1. The form for creating email templates i.e. resources/views/invoice/emailtemplate/form.php has been split into form_invoice and form_quote</p>
<p>2. All the form inputs have been html encoded and the forms have been converted to using Yiisoft php code instead of the HTML. </p>
<p>3. The generator has been used to help develop the new InvSentLog Entity and has been upgraded. Further refinements will naturally occur with continued use of the Generator. </p>
<p>4. Purpose of InvSentLog: Log or record all invoices that have been sent by email to a specific customer. The index can be filtered according to invoice number on both the Client and Admin side. </p>
<p>5. The Admin side can also filter the emails according to client name. The user associated with this client is also shown.</p>
<p>6. An additional field has been created for Client i.e. Title. The dropdown for this is built from the language folder invoice\resources\messages\en\app.php.</p>
<p>7. jQuery has been upgraded to the latest. i.e. ui 1.13.2 to 1.13.3. and 3.6.0 to 3.7.1</p>
<p>8. The UserInv index now includes the function revoke all roles i.e. revoke the Accountant and Observer role . Excludes the Administrator role. 
<p>9. A few temporary forks i.e. rossaddison/... have been created whilst vjik is busy with the upgrades. These will be removed later.
<p>10. The mailer had a bug which has been fixed and has been tested with a few emails. </p>
<p><b>24th April 2024</b></p>
<p>Include stopLoggingIn and stopSigningUp variable into the LayoutViewInjection</p>
<p>Include these variables into main.php</p> 
<p>Replace currentRoute with RouteArguments in InvoiceController.php</p>
<p>The $debugMode variable now is linked to the .env file. Alter the debugMode in the .env file now instead of the LayoutViewInjection.
   If the $_ENV['BUILD_DATABASE']  environment variable is linked directly in the config/common params.php file it results in performance degradation so leave the setitng on 'false' for the moment.
</p>
<p><b>13th April 2024</b></p>
<p>1. Create a function userinv/guestlimit which stores a guest user's page size limiter selector's last choice.</p>
<p>2. This value is then specific to the user and separate from the default_page_size limiter.</p>
<p>3. Introduce all the invoice statuses to the guest grid.</p>
<p>4. Create a separate payment guest index page for logged in users with clients.</p>
<p>5. Create a separate payment online log guest index page for logged in users with clients.</p>
<p>6. Added the extra field to user inv: ListLimit</p>
<p>7. Adjusted the layouts i.e. ...resources/views/layout guest.php, main.php, and invoice.php
      to better reflect the logo.
</p>
<p>8. Adjusted the pdfHelper to accomodate additional templates. It should be noted that mpdfHelper is not bootstrap compatible.</p>
<p>9. Include two filters InvNumer and Inv Amount Total into the guest grid.</p>
<p>10. Include the additional Invoice statuses into the InvRepository statuses array.</p>
<p>11. Include an addition buttonsGuest function into the PageSizeLimiter widget used for guest users paying off Invoices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2nd April 2024</b></p>
<p>1. The debug mode setting, normally situated in ..\views\layout\invoice\main.php, has been moved to the </p>
<p>   ..\src\ViewInjection\LayoutViewInjection.php return array i.e.  'debugMode' => true, </p>
<p>2. A few basic front pages have been created for the site using 
    <a href="https://bootstrapbrain.com/template/free-bootstrap-5-multipurpose-one-page-template-wave/">
        BootstrapBrain Wavelight Free Template
    </a>
    to illustrate the common view injection.
</p>
<p>3. All dependency classes e.g. bsb- have been removed from the template and just raw bootstrap 5 code remains</p>
<p>4. An acknowledgement link has been included on the about page.</p>
<p>5. A soletrader layout template has been created to illustrate the ..\src\ViewInjection\CommonViewInjection.php pages. i.e. ..resources\views\layout\templates\soletrader\main.php</p>    
<p>6. The front pages use the variables declared in the CommonViewInjection.php pages.</p>
<p>7. The Mollie Payment Api has been introduced. <a>https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-php</a>
      A redirectUrl and not a webhookUrl is being used. After clients make payment on the Mollie site,
      they are redirected back with the invoice_url_key. This is matched with Mollie's metadata invoice_url_key.
      A payment table appears above the invoice view on successful payment.
</p>
<p>8. Invoices are accepting payments. TODO: Refunds will be available on balancing credit notes if the invoice has a payment.
<p>
<p>9. Updated custom fields index.</p>
<p>10. Payment gateways Amazon, Stripe, and Mollie have been tested.</p>
<p>11. Functions within the PaymentInformationController have been renamed from 'form' to 'inform' to
       better reflect the fact that data is not being captured on a form for pci compliance purposes.
</p>
<p>12. Additional invoice statuses have been included in inv/getStatuses(Translator $translator) namely
       unpaid, reminder, letter, claim, judgement, enforcement, credit_invoice_for_invoice, loss 
</p>

<p><b>20th December 2022</b></p>
<p>1. Moved repository into separate working folder under blog, and blog-api for separate github workflow purposes.</p>
<p>2. Invoice works separately from blog. There are no hyperlinks to blog.</p>
<p>3. The Entity User's relations to comment and post have been removed since these are no longer needed.<br>
However the user that is registered under the demo still has to be added to the userinv table using Setting...User Account.    
</p>
<p>4. New Setting: <b>Invoices marked as 'sent' when copying</b> so that a client can view them online immediately without having to be sent by email. See Settings...View...Invoices...Other Settings. This is also useful for testing a series of invoices against a payment gateway.</p>
<p>5. A checkbox 'sandbox' has been added to the SettingsRepository/payment_gateways array for amazon_pay, and braintree.
If you plan to use a language other than English, you will need to include <code>'online_payment_sandbox' => 'Sandbox',</code> in the corresponding src/Invoice/Language/{your_language}/gateway_lang.php file. 
ie. check that the gateway_lang.php in the English folder corresponds with your language folder.
<p>6. The omnipay payment gateway with stripe will give the following warning (which is not recommended to accept): </p>
<p>Payment failed. Please try again. Response: Sending credit card numbers directly to the Stripe API is generally unsafe. We suggest you use test tokens that map to the test card you are using, see https://stripe.com/docs/testing.</p>
<p>You will have to go into https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/integration and toggle the following screen.</p>

<p>9. Braintree Payment Gateway has been introduced. </p>
<code>
    /**
     * @psalm-suppress InvalidReturnType, InvalidReturnStatement, UndefinedInterfaceMethod
     */
</code>
<p>This will need to be looked at later.</p>     
<p><b>10th December 2022</b></p>
<p>Github Static Analysis: Psalm Level 7,6,5,4 testing - errors 0</p>
<p>1. Payment and Merchant (Online log) views upgraded to GridView.</p>
<p>2. A subarray has been added to the gateway array under SettingRepository/payment_gateways function <code>'version' => array(
                    'type' => 'checkbox',
                    'label' => 'Omnipay Version'                    
                    )</code><br>This is to facilitate the introduction of PCI compliant gateways. The two pci compliant tested gateways introduced here are: Stripe version 10 and Amazon_Pay. </p>
<p>3. If the above 'Omnipay version' checkbox is left unchecked for the specific gateway, you are implying that it is PCI compliant.</p>
<p>4. Uncheck 'Omnipay version' for Stripe Version 10 and the latest Amazon_Pay which have been introduced here.  </p>
<p>5. The guest url has been removed from the guest view. The user/client when logged in with 'observer role', has a list of enabled gateways in a list under options under the guest's invoice view. </p> 
<p>6. Stripe version 10 is PCI compliant because their js.stripe.com/v3 cdn is dealt with directly and no credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>7. Amazon Pay is PCI compliant because the user/client has to be logged into amazon.co.uk before they can use the Amazon Button. No credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>8. The PaymentInformationForm includes place to enter credit card details but this form only presents itself with Omnipay version checked gateways.
<p>9. The PaymentInformationController handles Omnipay and PCI compliant gateways.</p>
<p>10. Amazon_Pay has been integrated with productType set to PayOnly (see function form) so clients can pay if they have an Amazon Account.  </p>
<p>11. Register as a developer under Stripe to test the Omnipay Integration.
<p>12. The following code under ...resources/views/invoice/paymentinformation/payment_information_stripe_pci is of importance.</p>    
<p><code>. 'async function initialize() {'<br>
        // To avoid Error 422 Unprocessible entity <br>
        // const { clientSecret } = await fetch("/create.php", {<br>
        // method: "POST",<br>
        // headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },<br>
        // body: JSON.stringify({ items }),<br>
        // }).then((r) => r.json());<br>    
        . 'const { clientSecret } = {"clientSecret": "'. $client_secret .'"};'<br>
        . 'elements = stripe.elements({ clientSecret });'<br>
        . 'const paymentElementOptions = {'<br>

        . '};'<br>
        . 'const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);'<br>
        . 'paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");'<br>
    . '}'<br>
    </code>
</p>
<p>13. Stripe version 10 is working for debit/credit cards and for bacs. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/site/stripe_v_10.png" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>14. Amazon Pay v2.40 is working if you are signed in to Amazon concurrently. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/site/amazon_pay_v_2_40.png" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>15. The PaymentController and MerchantController guest related functions adopt the same approach as the InvController:</p>
<p><code>
        // Get the current user and determine from (@see Settings...User Account) whether they have been given <br>
        // either guest or admin rights. These rights are unrelated to rbac and serve as a second <br>
        // 'line of defense' to support role based admin control. <br>
        <br> 
        // Retrieve the user from Yii-Demo's list of users in the User Table <br>
        $user = $this->user_service->getUser(); <br>         
        <br>
        // Use this user's id to see whether a user has been setup under UserInv ie. yii-invoice's list of users <br>
        $userinv = ($uiR->repoUserInvUserIdcount((string)$user->getId()) > 0 <br>
                 ? $uiR->repoUserInvUserIdquery((string)$user->getId()) <br>
                 : null); <br>
        <br>        
        // Determine what clients have been allocated to this user (@see Settings...User Account) <br>
        // by looking at UserClient table <br>       
        <br>                
        // eg. If the user is a guest-accountant, they will have been allocated certain clients <br>
        // A user-quest-accountant will be allocated a series of clients <br>
        // A user-guest-client will be allocated their client number by the administrator so that <br>
        // they can view their invoices and make payment <br>
        $user_clients = (null!== $userinv ? $ucR->get_assigned_to_user($user->getId()) : []);</code>

</p>
<b>Setting Up</b>
<p>The settings table builds up initially with a default array of settings via the InvoiceController if they do not exist ie. setting 'default_settings_exist' does not exist.</p>
<b>Generator</b>
<p>The code generator templates have been adapted according to the latest demo updates.</p>
<b>Annotations</b>
<p>The lengthy Entity annotations have been replaced with the more concise Attributes coding structure. eg. <code> * @ORM\Column(type="string")</code>
    replaced with <code>#[ORM\Column(type: "string")]</code>. <s>However issue 439 is currently relevant here.</s>  
</p>
<b>Demo Mode</b>
<p>A demo mode variable located in src\Invoice\Layout\main.php ie. <code>$demo_mode</code> can be set to false to remove performance settings and the clear cache tool.
All areas in red will be removed.</p>
<b>Jquery</b>
<p>Jquery  3.6.0 (March 2nd 2021) version is being used for custom fields, and smaller modals. Temporarily, Invoiceplane's dependencies.js file is being used in AppAsset.
The modals are dependent on it. </p>
<b>Html Tags on Views</b>
<p>Views can be improved with more Yii related tags ie. using <code>Html::tag</code>. Html::encode is mandatory or compulsory or always present.</p>
<b>Paginator</b>
<p>The length of the lists can be changed via setting/view: <code>default_list_limit</code></p>
<b>Locales</b>
<p>The SettingRepository <code>load_language_folder</code> function accepts the dropdown locale through yiisoft/demo's <code>$session->get('_language')</code> function: this setting takes precedence over the database 'default_language' setting when set.</p>
<b>Client's language different to locale_derived_language or fallback settings 'default_language'</b>
<p>When printing occurs, the client's language ensures the documentation is printed out in his/her language using <code>$session->get('print_language')</code>
<p>The session variable <code>print_language</code> is reset after printing.</p>    
<b>Languages</b>
<p>Any words used not in the Invoiceplane folders, will be translated using Yii's translation methodology.</p>
<p>The above menu's language can be created in ...resources/messages for a specific language.
<p>Language folders can be imported from Invoiceplane but the following code must be inserted in each file <code>declare(strict_types=1);</code>within that folder.</p>
<b>Steps to include a language</b>
<p>1. Include the language folder in src/Invoice/Language after including declare(strict_types) in each file.</p>
<p>2. Include the new language in SettingsRepository's locale_language_array</p>
<p>3. Adjust the config/params.php locales array.</p>
<p>4. Adjust the views/layout/main.php menu.</p>
<p>5. Adjust each of the resources/messages folders language array.</p>
<p>6. CJK (C(hinese) J(apanese) K(orean) Languages <a href="https://mpdf.github.io/fonts-languages/cjk-languages.html"></a>
In order to view a file with non-embedded CJK (chinese-japanese-korean) fonts, you - and other users - need to download the Asian font pack for Adobe Reader for the languages:

Chinese (Simplified),
Chinese (Traditional),
Korean,
and Japanese

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/windows-font-packs-32-bit-reader.html">For Windows</a>
<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/macintosh-font-packs�acrobat�reader-.html">For Mac</a></p>
<p>If spaces appear where the language should appear whilst viewing using eg. Chrome default PDF reader, add the extension - Chrome PDF Viewer 2.3.164.</p>
<p>7. When copying, and pasting the Chinese Simplified folder make sure that you remove the space between the Chinese and Simplified. ie. ChineseSimplified. This is camelcase. </p>
<b>Netbeans: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59800221/gradle-netbeans-howto-set-encoding-to-utf-8-in-editor-and-compiler">How to include UTF-8 in Netbeans</a></b>
<p>Set encoding used in Netbeans globally to UTF-8. Added in netbeans.conf "-J-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" to parameter "netbeans_default_options". This unfortunately has
to be done everytime you edit a file with 'special letters'. So edit the file with the UTF-8 setting above, save it, and then remove the above setting from Netbeans.conf. </p> 
<p>File Location: C:\Program Files\NetBeans-16\netbeans\etc\netbeans.conf open with notepad cntrl+F netbeans_default_options </p>
<b>Improved Features</b>
<p>A start tax year date eg. 06/04/2022 can be setup under view so that reports will use this by default as their start date.</p>
<p>The invoice aging report includes the invoice number(s) of the outstanding balance.</p>
<p>The Sales by Client report includes more specifics including the Sales without Tax, Item Tax, and Invoice Tax, and Sales Inclusive amount.</p>
<p>The Sales by Date (aka Sales by Year) report breaks each Sales per Client into quarters over the selected years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple products of quantity of 1 can be selected from the products lookup with the 'burger' or '3 horizontal lines' icon whilst in quote.</p>
<p>Multiple items can be deleted under the options button with 'Delete Item'.</p>
<p>Company details are divided into public and private. The profile table is intended for multiple profiles especially when email addresses, and mobile numbers change.</p>
<p>If a Tax -Rate is set to default, it will be used on all new quotes and invoices. ie. A Quote Tax Rate will be created from this Tax Rate automatically and will be created and used on all new quotes. The same will apply to all invoices.</p>
<p>If you want to create a quote or an invoice group, specific to a client, use the Setting...Group feature to setup a Group identifier eg. JOE for the  JOE Ltd Company. The next id will be appended to JOE ie. JOE001.</p>
<p>Products and Tasks can be entered separately on an invoice and are mutually exclusive so if you enter a task you cannot enter a product at the same time.</p>
<b>Deprecated Original Features</b>
<p>Themes will be introduced at a later date.</p>
<p>It is not intended to deprecate any of the features currently in InvoicePlane.</p>
<b>Proposed Features</b>
<p>Upgrading the forms to include the demo's php or server based form structure.</p>
<p>An interlinked basic bookkeeping system to audit transactions and produce an audit trail of invoices and payments</p>
<b>Security</b>
<p>All Entity properties initialized before the construct should be private. The private property is accessed through a public getter method as built below the construct.</p>
<b>Reasons for using a simplified <code>id</code> as a primary key in all the tables</b>
<p>See <a href="https://cycle-orm.dev/docs/annotated-relations/1.x/en#belongsto">{relationName}_{outerKey}</a>, the outerKey being the primary key, structure. 
    Eg. the field <code>tax_rate_id</code> in the Product table is a relation or a foreign key in the Product table equal and pointing to its parent table's Tax Rate's <code>id</code>  
    so the relation name <b>variable</b> in Entity: Product must be <code>$tax_rate</code> and joined with the outerKey as <code>$id</code> you get <code>$tax_rate_id</code> which matches the foreign key <code>$tax_rate_id</code> in Entity: Product
    If the primary key in the Tax Rate table was named something like tax_rate_id and not id then the relation could not be given a name.
</p>
<b>Future Work</b>
<p>Psalm static testing and removing of INFO suggestions.</p>
<p>Yiisoft's Mailer function incorporated using adminEmail as default config param for userinv->email.</p>
<p>A new feature of product custom fields has to be developed.</p>
<p>Client Custom Fields dependency on client_custom_fields.js will be removed as has been done for Payment Custom Fields. </p>
<p>Redundant functions generated by the Generator have to be deleted.</p>
<b>Work in progress</b>
<p>The client/view has been developed but the index under the Client View has to be rebuilt using the code similar to the new Invoice index.</p>
<p>The dashboard is being developed with Sumex still to be incorporated.</p>
<p>All the settings in the setting view,  still have to be linked to their specific purpose by consulting with the Original Invoiceplane code. Progress on this has been made especially with the Email tab.</p>
<p>All forms have to be modified from Html to Yii3's php based form structure.
<p>Email Template</p>
<p>User custom fields have to be developed.</p>
<p>Accessing a quote using the url_key in the browser is possible now by a customer. The url_key is retrieved at the bottom of the  quote by admin and pasted into an email. Login as a user who has the observer role with user_id 7, (after the 6 dummy users in demo) to test the customer's login ability. The customer can be sent the url_key (instead of the actual quote) by email. The user can then accept or reject the quote online using this url_key. This quote can then be copied to an invoice by the administrator if accepted by the customer.</p>
