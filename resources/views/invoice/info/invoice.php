<h6 id="invoice">Development Summary: (...resources/views/invoice/info/invoice.php)</h6>

<p><b>Aim: To develop a similar invoicing system to InvoicePlane with <s>integrating with the latest Jquery, and</s> the security features of Yii3, Snyk, CodeQl using wampserver 
        as a test platform for WAMP and also lightweight Alpine / heavier Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for LAMP.</b>
</p>
<p>Less emphasis has been placed on using javascript due to security vulnerabilities with jQuery. More emphasis is being placed on using php forms instead of javascript. </p> 
<p>Free sponsorship has been provided by vultr.com in Frankfurt on 209.250.232.212</p>
<p>The domain yii3i.co.uk will be moved over to 209.250.232.212 in September from hosts one.com. The vultr.com site is running on alpine and copilot AI has been most useful in helping me set this up.</p>
<p><b>To Do's - Longer Term Goals</b></p>
<p>1. <s>Integration of Payment Gateways</s>PCI Compliant Stripe, Amazon Pay, Braintree, and Mollie have been introduced.</p>
<p>2. Accountant Role with the ability of an accountant/bookkeeper to record payments against invoices.</p>
<p><s>3. Include a <b>Company Private Detail</b> specific logo on a pdf invoice.</s></p>
<p>4. Acceptance Tests for Invoice</p>
<p>5. Further validation and exceptions to be included in testing of e-Invoicing using PeppolHelper.</p>
<p><s>6. Filters to be introduced on grids</s></p>
<p><s>7. Improve Generator index template using Yiisoft functions.</s></p>
<p><s>8. Include Product images</s></p>
<p><s>9. Remove all $s variables passed to views since the variable is defined under config/params.php</s></p>
<p>10. Upskilling on Docker. </p>

<p>Two Factor Authentication using Aegis Authenticator app for android is functional</p>
<p>Enable Two Factor Authentication under Settings ... View ... Two Factor Authentication</p>
<p>Two options exist with this setting: </p>
<p>Option 1: With disabling: i.e. always show Qr code. Two Factor Authentication is currently enabled for additional security and is disabled after successful authentication for an additional layer of security until the next login. The Qr code will be presented each time after login for a new secret.</p>
<p>Option 2: Without disabling: i.e. Qr code shown once only during setup. Two Factor Authentication is currently enabled for additional security and is not disabled after successful authentication. The Qr code will not be presented each time after logging in after setting up.</p>
<p>When tfa starts, a new permission noEntryToBaseController is created. This prevents access to the BaseController</p>
<p>As soon as tfa ends, a new permission entryToBaseController is created. This remains until logging out.</p>

src\Widget\SubMenu compiles from an array specified in the layout  
</p>
<p><b>3rd April 2025</b></p>
<p>
Introduce CategoryPrimary and CategorySecondary Class in preparation for a dependency dropdown. They have not been built into the menu yet.

Psalm: Insert Final Class into all classes besides Entity Classes since these have to be non-final since they are extended by the Cycle/ORM proxy to create proxies.

Remove 'Invalid Argument' from psalm since all errors have been corrected.

Tip for solving difficult psalm errors: Ask Copilot online with the repository open at a specific page:  Insert Line number: Psalm Error press enter. Apply the suggestion.

Run 'php vendor/bin/psalter --issues=MissingOverrideAttribute' at the command prompt to install the #Override attribute automatically.

see https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/issues/MissingOverrideAttribute/

psalm-suppress 16 NonInvariantDocblockPropertyType errors relating to Assets $js and $css

Update the \invoice\resources\views\invoice\generator\templates_protected files after creating the CategoryPrimary and CategorySecondary classes and views with the Generator.
Improvements to the Generator will improve with use.</p>
<p><b>30 March 2025</b></p>
<p>html encode check of views</p>
<p><b>26 March 2025</b></p>
<p>Removed the session interface from SettingRepository because console commands that use the SettingRepository do not use Session.</p>
<p>Only the Required red reminder hints are on the client forms. 'Not Required have been removed on the client forms. This will speed up the signing up of clients.</p>
<p>Client form's number of Required fields has been reduced to reduce input.</p>
<p>The following commands (config/console/commands.php and src/Command/Invoice) can be used at the console: </p>
<p>yii invoice/items -- creates a list of random invoice items with a Summary Table for the Item tax and two Invoice specific Taxes of 15% and 20%.</p>
<p>yii invoice/setting/truncate -- removes all the settings in the setting table -- An array in future can be passed to the InvoiceController which can be tweaked from within the config/common/params.</p>
<p>yii invoice/generator/truncate -- removes all the records in the gentor and gentor relation tables -- Reuse the generator to build CRUD for another something else.</p>
<p>yii invoice/inv/truncate1 -- removes all invoices and invoice related tables -- for development testing</p>
<p>yii invoice/quote/truncate2 -- removes all quotes and quote related tables -- for development testing</p>
<p>yii invoice/salesorder/truncate3 -- removes all salesorder and salesorder related tables for development testing</p>
<p>yii invoice/nonuserrelated/truncate4 -- removes all subsequent tables besides tables responsible for logging in</p>
<p>Console commands with a number after truncate  indicates the general sequence in order to avoid integrity constraint violations</p>
<p>General Rule of Thumb to avoid integrity constraint violations: If a table contains a foreign key e.g. tax_rate_id, then the TaxRate Table will be truncated later</p>
<p>Apply https://github.com/yiisoft/router/pull/262/files Hashing to urls in breadcrumbs for quick access to settings.</p>
<p>Bugfix printing of pdf documents in a client\'s language. The default language setting will be used to print documents unless the client has a different language.</p>
<p>Set the locale when the view is being rendered partially i.e. without a layout using <pre>$translator->setLocale($cldr);</pre></p>
<p>Include some functional tests with <pre>php vendor/bin/codecept run</pre></p>

<p>1. Include a function blockInvalidState in all the AuthController callback clients which checks for csrf attacks </p>
<p>and null session Auth state. Copilot was asked a question regarding this however the yii-auth-client repository </p>
<p>already stores the state during the yii-auth-client oauth2 buildAuthUrl function as 'authState'. </p>
<p>This value is compared with the state value returned by the IdentityProvider and if compared and </p>
<p>they are not the same then there is likely a csrf attack. This potential has been included as well </p>
<p>as potential for a null value since the AuthClient getState function is mixed so can return either a string value or null.</p>

<p><b>25th December 2024</b></p>
<p>Github Oauth2 functional. A Github user is authenticated, signed up, and assigned a client automatically without disclosing passwords.</p>
<p>A new oAuthService function oauthLogin has been created which does not require a password since authentication is already provided by Github.</p>
<p>In summary, the user is found by means of their login i.e. username with code<pre>
    Auth\AuthService
    
    public function oauthLogin(string $login): bool
    {
        $user = $this->userRepository->findByLoginWithAuthIdentity($login);
        
        if ($user === null) {
            return false;
        }

        return $this->currentUser->login($user->getIdentity());
    }
</pre> and using the user identity, the current user is logged in.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> When the user chooses to 'Continue to Github', Github returns an access token using <pre>$oAuthTokenType = $this->github->fetchAccessToken($request, $code, $params = [])</pre>, 
   and we use this token in a header request, to get information from the user by means of the Github Client in fork rossaddison/yii-auth-client
   <pre>$this->github->getCurrentUserJsonArray($oAuthTokenType);</pre>
   The auth/callbackGithub function concatenates a user using:</p>
<pre> $login = 'github'.(string)$githubId.$githubLogin;</pre>
<p>a. 'github' ... to distinguish it from other Identity Providers.</p>
<p>b. The Github Id which is an integer and naturally unique. </p>
<p>c. and the Github 'login' or username which is perhaps not that unique and may have been used more than once by the user when registering with other Identity Providers e.g LinkedIn</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> A random string password is built but will never be used and is hashed.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> The authService attempts to 'first time login' with this 'login' and deactivate the hour token ...otherwise a new user, and userinv is created, directing the user to login with their Identity Provider. </p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> The user must click on the 'please click here within the next hour to make active' button, to avoid our 'Github Access Token' from expiring.  
<p>Like the email verification token, our Github Access Token is set at an hour or 3600 seconds, allowing the user to activate and login within the hour and is unrelated to the Application's Github Access Token received from Github in step 1.</p>

<p><b>Step 2. </b><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">GitHub's OAuth implementation supports the standard authorization code grant type</a>    
<p><b>Step 3. </b><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow">We are using the web application flow.</a>
<p><b>Step 4. </b><a href="https://github.com/settings/applications/new">Register your application</a></p>
<p><b>Step 5a. </b>Request a User's Web Identity with <pre>GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize</pre> and <pre>query parameters client_id, redirect_url, state, login</pre></p>
<p><b>Step 5b. </b>Users are redirected back to your site with a temporary code. Exchange this code for an access token using endpoint <pre>POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token</pre> with parameters client_id, client_secret, code, redirect_url
e.g. of an access token <pre>access_token=gho_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a&scope=repo%2Cgist&token_type=bearer</pre> and if accept headers used ..in either json or xml format.</p>
<p><b>Step 5c. </b> The src/Auth/Controller/AuthController.php function callbackGithub, <s>with Middleware Authentication class</s> receives the query parameters code and state from Github.</p>
<p><b>Step 5d. </b>If the code is not an unauthorised 401 and the state param is not empty, fetch the token <pre>function OAuth2->fetchAccessToken</pre>.
<p><b>Step 5e. </b>If an official token is received, then use the Access token to access the Api on behalf of a user using <pre>Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN<br>
GET https://api.github.com/user</pre><p>
<p><b>Step 5f. </b>Use the function vendor/rossaddison/yii-auth-client/src/Client/Github.php getCurrentUserJsonArray(OAuthToken $token) to use the built OauthToken Type with param 'access-token' specific to Github to access the user details e.g login i.e repository base, and id. </p>

<p>1. User clicks on 'I forgot my password' on login form. </p>
<p>2. src/Auth/Controller/ForgotPasswordController. function forgot - Request Password Reset Token Form is presented for User to enter email address</p>
<p>3. When the form is submitted, an email with a masked link is sent to the user's inbox.</p>
<p>4a. A viewInjection site/forgotalert is presented encouraging the user to click on the link in their inbox.</p>
<p>4b. A viewInjection site/forgotfailed is presented, if the sites senderEmail has not been setup encouraging the user to setup their config/common/params.php senderEmail.</p>
<p>5. When the masked link is clicked, the src/Auth/ResetPasswordController.php function resetpassword unmasks the token.</p>
<p>6. A form with a 'new password' field and a 'verify new password' field is presented if the now unmasked token matches the 32bit string in Token->token with type 'request-password-reset'</p>
<p>7. As soon as this form is submitted, the following algorithm 
       https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/frontend/models/ResetPasswordForm.php is followed:</p> 
<pre>
   1.) setPassword in User 
   2.) nullify PasswordResetToken by setting the Token:token to null but retaining the Token:type 
       so that the token can no longer be used.  
   3.) generateAuthKey in Identity

<p>8. A viewInjection site/resetpasswordsuccess 'Password Reset' is shown if the password has changed.</p>
<p>9. A viewInjection site/resetpasswordfailed 'An error occurred while trying to send your password reset email. 
      Please review the application logs or contact the system administrator.' is shown if the password has failed.</p>

<p><b>User signup: </b></p>
<p>1. src/Auth/Controller/SignUpController function signup - Signup Form is hydrated or filled with login i.e. username, password, and email address</p>
<p>2. A user count is made, and if this is the first user i.e count == 1, the user is assigned an admin role. Otherwise an observer role is allocated. Viewed at resources/rbac/assignments.php</p>
<p>3a. An email verification token is generated with a random string of 32 and then Masked with Yiisoft\Security\TokenMask before sending by email.</p>
<p>3b. The type of the token i.e.  email-verification-token, is stored along with the unmasked token in the token table which holds the different types of tokens.</p>
<p>4. A try-catch statement will raise an exception if the email is not sent and therefore redirect.
<p>5. As soon as the user clicks on the link in their inbox, the config/common/routes/routes.php userinv/signup/{language}/{token} route is used.
<p>6. There is no AccessChecker Middleware on this route => for security...the use of the email-verification-token.</p>
<p>7. A new window is opened when the link is clicked, and arguments language, and token in route are used, and the token is then unmasked.</p>
<p>8. The timestamped email-verification-token is split into its token and timestamp, allowing an hour (3600 secs) as limit for user to verify via email.</p>
<p>9. The identity of the user is then found by means of this token referring to src/auth/tokenRepository.</p>
<p>10. If the 'signup_automatically_assign_client' has been setup by the admin under Settings...General, the observer user will be assigned one client automatically. This client is identified with the same email address as the user.</p>
<p>11. The admin has a flash message 'on button' option to choose this option after signing in once signed up. </p>
<p>12. Quotes and invoices can then be automatically created for this client without the need to assign a client manually to the userinv (extension table of user) account.</p>
<p>13. The client index has been consolidated freeing up space.</p>
<p>14. The client form has required and essential fields appearing first at the top. The client entity adopts this ordering of fields as well.</p>
<p>15. Bugfix on the company_logo_and_address</p>
<p>16. Settings ... General includes two new settings 'Assign a client to user upon signing up' and 'Assign a client with default minimum age of eighteen to the user upon signing up'. Included in defaults in InvoiceController.</p>
<p>17. Removed the password field on the extension table userinv since the password is hashed in the user table.</p>
<p>18. Added an email field to the signup form</p>
<p>19, There is no need for a user_id field in the Identity entity because the hasOne Identity relation in the User table automatically creates this
<p>20. Bugfix Auth/Token 'type' changed from integer to string</p>
<p>21. The column types in the Client Entity have been improved.</p>
<p>22. The size of an email field in the User table is a standard 254 characters.</p>
<p>23. The salt, email, and the passwordresettoken fields have been removed from userinv (InvoicePlanes user table) since these will be handled independently by the the token and identity table. </p>
<p>24. The token table will be saving the different types of tokens. The token table can be moved to a 'blog-api' but will be kept inclusive for the time being.</p>
<p>25. Include an additional setting in common/config/params symfony-mailer 'enabled' as a checked used in the SignUpController.php</p>
<p>Next: Forgot Password link on login form and reset-password-token and remember-me-token. </p>

        This script checks if your server configuration meets the requirements
        for running Yii application.
        It checks if the server is running the right version of PHP,
        if appropriate PHP extensions have been loaded, and if php.ini file settings are correct.

<p><b>22nd June 2024</b></p>
<p>1. Include a requirements checker under FAQ's using newish repo 'yiisoft/requirements'.</p>
<p>2. Tested the Generator with a dummy Entity and updated the Generator with a few additional fixes.</p>
<p>3. Included actual ini_get values under the performance section on the main menu.</p>
<p>4. Alphabetical reordering of composer .json. (Except Payment Providers and rossaddison/ temporary
 forks which will be removed later).</p>
<p>5. docker-compose.yml does not require the version number anymore.</p>
<p><b>14th June 2024</b></p>
<p>1. The form for creating email templates i.e. resources/views/invoice/emailtemplate/form.php has been split into form_invoice and form_quote</p>
<p>2. All the form inputs have been html encoded and the forms have been converted to using Yiisoft php code instead of the HTML. </p>
<p>3. The generator has been used to help develop the new InvSentLog Entity and has been upgraded. Further refinements will naturally occur with continued use of the Generator. </p>
<p>4. Purpose of InvSentLog: Log or record all invoices that have been sent by email to a specific customer. The index can be filtered according to invoice number on both the Client and Admin side. </p>
<p>5. The Admin side can also filter the emails according to client name. The user associated with this client is also shown.</p>
<p>6. An additional field has been created for Client i.e. Title. The dropdown for this is built from the language folder invoice\resources\messages\en\app.php.</p>
<p>7. jQuery has been upgraded to the latest. i.e. ui 1.13.2 to 1.13.3. and 3.6.0 to 3.7.1</p>
<p>8. The UserInv index now includes the function revoke all roles i.e. revoke the Accountant and Observer role . Excludes the Administrator role. 
<p>9. A few temporary forks i.e. rossaddison/... have been created whilst vjik is busy with the upgrades. These will be removed later.
<p>10. The mailer had a bug which has been fixed and has been tested with a few emails. </p>
<p><b>24th April 2024</b></p>
<p>Include stopLoggingIn and stopSigningUp variable into the LayoutViewInjection</p>
<p>Include these variables into main.php</p> 
<p>Replace currentRoute with RouteArguments in InvoiceController.php</p>
<p>The $debugMode variable now is linked to the .env file. Alter the debugMode in the .env file now instead of the LayoutViewInjection.
   If the $_ENV['BUILD_DATABASE']  environment variable is linked directly in the config/common params.php file it results in performance degradation so leave the setitng on 'false' for the moment.
</p>
<p><b>13th April 2024</b></p>
<p>1. Create a function userinv/guestlimit which stores a guest user's page size limiter selector's last choice.</p>
<p>2. This value is then specific to the user and separate from the default_page_size limiter.</p>
<p>3. Introduce all the invoice statuses to the guest grid.</p>
<p>4. Create a separate payment guest index page for logged in users with clients.</p>
<p>5. Create a separate payment online log guest index page for logged in users with clients.</p>
<p>6. Added the extra field to user inv: ListLimit</p>
<p>7. Adjusted the layouts i.e. ...resources/views/layout guest.php, main.php, and invoice.php
      to better reflect the logo.
</p>
<p>8. Adjusted the pdfHelper to accomodate additional templates. It should be noted that mpdfHelper is not bootstrap compatible.</p>
<p>9. Include two filters InvNumer and Inv Amount Total into the guest grid.</p>
<p>10. Include the additional Invoice statuses into the InvRepository statuses array.</p>
<p>11. Include an addition buttonsGuest function into the PageSizeLimiter widget used for guest users paying off Invoices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2nd April 2024</b></p>
<p>1. The debug mode setting, normally situated in ..\views\layout\invoice\main.php, has been moved to the </p>
<p>   ..\src\ViewInjection\LayoutViewInjection.php return array i.e.  'debugMode' => true, </p>
<p>2. A few basic front pages have been created for the site using 
    <a href="https://bootstrapbrain.com/template/free-bootstrap-5-multipurpose-one-page-template-wave/">
        BootstrapBrain Wavelight Free Template
    </a>
    to illustrate the common view injection.
</p>
<p>3. All dependency classes e.g. bsb- have been removed from the template and just raw bootstrap 5 code remains</p>
<p>4. An acknowledgement link has been included on the about page.</p>
<p>5. A soletrader layout template has been created to illustrate the ..\src\ViewInjection\CommonViewInjection.php pages. i.e. ..resources\views\layout\templates\soletrader\main.php</p>    
<p>6. The front pages use the variables declared in the CommonViewInjection.php pages.</p>
<p>7. The Mollie Payment Api has been introduced. <a>https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-php</a>
      A redirectUrl and not a webhookUrl is being used. After clients make payment on the Mollie site,
      they are redirected back with the invoice_url_key. This is matched with Mollie's metadata invoice_url_key.
      A payment table appears above the invoice view on successful payment.
</p>
<p>8. Invoices are accepting payments. TODO: Refunds will be available on balancing credit notes if the invoice has a payment.
<p>
<p>9. Updated custom fields index.</p>
<p>10. Payment gateways Amazon, Stripe, and Mollie have been tested.</p>
<p>11. Functions within the PaymentInformationController have been renamed from 'form' to 'inform' to
       better reflect the fact that data is not being captured on a form for pci compliance purposes.
</p>
<p>12. Additional invoice statuses have been included in inv/getStatuses(Translator $translator) namely
       unpaid, reminder, letter, claim, judgement, enforcement, credit_invoice_for_invoice, loss 
</p>

<p>8. The function src\User\Console\AssignRoleCommand and CreateCommand is functional as the observer role can be assigned to a client with the result ending up as an assignment in ...invoices/resources/rbac</p>
<p>How to reach Psalm level 4 the following code is needed to suppress Psalm errors on level 4: </p>
<p>9. Braintree Payment Gateway has been introduced. </p>
<code>
    /**
     * @psalm-suppress InvalidReturnType, InvalidReturnStatement, UndefinedInterfaceMethod
     */
</code>
<p>This will need to be looked at later.</p>     
<p><b>10th December 2022</b></p>
<p>Github Static Analysis: Psalm Level 7,6,5,4 testing - errors 0</p>
<p>1. Payment and Merchant (Online log) views upgraded to GridView.</p>
<p>2. A subarray has been added to the gateway array under SettingRepository/payment_gateways function <code>'version' => array(
                    'type' => 'checkbox',
                    'label' => 'Omnipay Version'                    
                    )</code><br>This is to facilitate the introduction of PCI compliant gateways. The two pci compliant tested gateways introduced here are: Stripe version 10 and Amazon_Pay. </p>
<p>3. If the above 'Omnipay version' checkbox is left unchecked for the specific gateway, you are implying that it is PCI compliant.</p>
<p>4. Uncheck 'Omnipay version' for Stripe Version 10 and the latest Amazon_Pay which have been introduced here.  </p>
<p>5. The guest url has been removed from the guest view. The user/client when logged in with 'observer role', has a list of enabled gateways in a list under options under the guest's invoice view. </p> 
<p>6. Stripe version 10 is PCI compliant because their js.stripe.com/v3 cdn is dealt with directly and no credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>7. Amazon Pay is PCI compliant because the user/client has to be logged into amazon.co.uk before they can use the Amazon Button. No credit card details are shared. </p>
<p>8. The PaymentInformationForm includes place to enter credit card details but this form only presents itself with Omnipay version checked gateways.
<p>9. The PaymentInformationController handles Omnipay and PCI compliant gateways.</p>
<p>10. Amazon_Pay has been integrated with productType set to PayOnly (see function form) so clients can pay if they have an Amazon Account.  </p>
<p>11. Register as a developer under Stripe to test the Omnipay Integration.
<p>12. The following code under ...resources/views/invoice/paymentinformation/payment_information_stripe_pci is of importance.</p>    
<p><code>. 'async function initialize() {'<br>
        // To avoid Error 422 Unprocessible entity <br>
        // const { clientSecret } = await fetch("/create.php", {<br>
        // method: "POST",<br>
        // headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },<br>
        // body: JSON.stringify({ items }),<br>
        // }).then((r) => r.json());<br>    
        . 'const { clientSecret } = {"clientSecret": "'. $client_secret .'"};'<br>
        . 'elements = stripe.elements({ clientSecret });'<br>
        . 'const paymentElementOptions = {'<br>
            . 'layout: "tabs"'<br>
        . '};'<br>
        . 'const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);'<br>
        . 'paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");'<br>
    . '}'<br>
    </code>
</p>
<p>13. Stripe version 10 is working for debit/credit cards and for bacs. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/site/stripe_v_10.png" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>14. Amazon Pay v2.40 is working if you are signed in to Amazon concurrently. Login as a user with observer role.</p>
<img src="/site/amazon_pay_v_2_40.png" height="300" width="450"/>
<p>15. The PaymentController and MerchantController guest related functions adopt the same approach as the InvController:</p>
<p><code>
        // Get the current user and determine from (@see Settings...User Account) whether they have been given <br>
        // either guest or admin rights. These rights are unrelated to rbac and serve as a second <br>
        // 'line of defense' to support role based admin control. <br>
        <br> 
        // Retrieve the user from Yii-Demo's list of users in the User Table <br>
        $user = $this->user_service->getUser(); <br>         
        <br>
        // Use this user's id to see whether a user has been setup under UserInv ie. yii-invoice's list of users <br>
        $userinv = ($uiR->repoUserInvUserIdcount((string)$user->getId()) > 0 <br>
                 ? $uiR->repoUserInvUserIdquery((string)$user->getId()) <br>
                 : null); <br>
        <br>        
        // Determine what clients have been allocated to this user (@see Settings...User Account) <br>
        // by looking at UserClient table <br>       
        <br>                
        // eg. If the user is a guest-accountant, they will have been allocated certain clients <br>
        // A user-quest-accountant will be allocated a series of clients <br>
        // A user-guest-client will be allocated their client number by the administrator so that <br>
        // they can view their invoices and make payment <br>
        $user_clients = (null!== $userinv ? $ucR->get_assigned_to_user($user->getId()) : []);</code>

<p>Settings...View(Non-Debug mode ie. Not Red) - Some are being used. Their functionality is currently being analysed in Invoiceplane.--</p>
<p>The userinv table is an extension of yii/demo's user table and contains all the critical user information.</p>
</p>
<b>Setting Up</b>
<p>The settings table builds up initially with a default array of settings via the InvoiceController if they do not exist ie. setting 'default_settings_exist' does not exist.</p>
<b>Generator</b>
<p>The code generator templates have been adapted according to the latest demo updates.</p>
<b>Annotations</b>
<p>The lengthy Entity annotations have been replaced with the more concise Attributes coding structure. eg. <code> * @ORM\Column(type="string")</code>
    replaced with <code>#[ORM\Column(type: "string")]</code>. <s>However issue 439 is currently relevant here.</s>  
</p>
<b>Demo Mode</b>
<p>A demo mode variable located in src\Invoice\Layout\main.php ie. <code>$demo_mode</code> can be set to false to remove performance settings and the clear cache tool.
All areas in red will be removed.</p>
<b>Jquery</b>
<p>Jquery  3.6.0 (March 2nd 2021) version is being used for custom fields, and smaller modals. Temporarily, Invoiceplane's dependencies.js file is being used in AppAsset.
The modals are dependent on it. </p>
<b>Html Tags on Views</b>
<p>Views can be improved with more Yii related tags ie. using <code>Html::tag</code>. Html::encode is mandatory or compulsory or always present.</p>
<b>Paginator</b>
<p>The length of the lists can be changed via setting/view: <code>default_list_limit</code></p>
<b>Locales</b>
<p>The SettingRepository <code>load_language_folder</code> function accepts the dropdown locale through yiisoft/demo's <code>$session->get('_language')</code> function: this setting takes precedence over the database 'default_language' setting when set.</p>
<b>Client's language different to locale_derived_language or fallback settings 'default_language'</b>
<p>When printing occurs, the client's language ensures the documentation is printed out in his/her language using <code>$session->get('print_language')</code>
<p>The session variable <code>print_language</code> is reset after printing.</p>    
<b>Languages</b>
<p>Any words used not in the Invoiceplane folders, will be translated using Yii's translation methodology.</p>
<p>The above menu's language can be created in ...resources/messages for a specific language.
<p>Language folders can be imported from Invoiceplane but the following code must be inserted in each file <code>declare(strict_types=1);</code>within that folder.</p>
<b>Steps to include a language</b>
<p>1. Include the language folder in src/Invoice/Language after including declare(strict_types) in each file.</p>
<p>2. Include the new language in SettingsRepository's locale_language_array</p>
<p>3. Adjust the config/params.php locales array.</p>
<p>4. Adjust the views/layout/main.php menu.</p>
<p>5. Adjust each of the resources/messages folders language array.</p>
<p>6. CJK (C(hinese) J(apanese) K(orean) Languages <a href="https://mpdf.github.io/fonts-languages/cjk-languages.html"></a>
In order to view a file with non-embedded CJK (chinese-japanese-korean) fonts, you - and other users - need to download the Asian font pack for Adobe Reader for the languages:

Chinese (Simplified),
Chinese (Traditional),
Korean,
and Japanese

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/windows-font-packs-32-bit-reader.html">For Windows</a>
<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/macintosh-font-packs�acrobat�reader-.html">For Mac</a></p>
<p>If spaces appear where the language should appear whilst viewing using eg. Chrome default PDF reader, add the extension - Chrome PDF Viewer 2.3.164.</p>
<p>7. When copying, and pasting the Chinese Simplified folder make sure that you remove the space between the Chinese and Simplified. ie. ChineseSimplified. This is camelcase. </p>
<b>Netbeans: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59800221/gradle-netbeans-howto-set-encoding-to-utf-8-in-editor-and-compiler">How to include UTF-8 in Netbeans</a></b>
<p>Set encoding used in Netbeans globally to UTF-8. Added in netbeans.conf "-J-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" to parameter "netbeans_default_options". This unfortunately has
to be done everytime you edit a file with 'special letters'. So edit the file with the UTF-8 setting above, save it, and then remove the above setting from Netbeans.conf. </p> 
<p>File Location: C:\Program Files\NetBeans-16\netbeans\etc\netbeans.conf open with notepad cntrl+F netbeans_default_options </p>
<b>Improved Features</b>
<p>A start tax year date eg. 06/04/2022 can be setup under view so that reports will use this by default as their start date.</p>
<p>The invoice aging report includes the invoice number(s) of the outstanding balance.</p>
<p>The Sales by Client report includes more specifics including the Sales without Tax, Item Tax, and Invoice Tax, and Sales Inclusive amount.</p>
<p>The Sales by Date (aka Sales by Year) report breaks each Sales per Client into quarters over the selected years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple products of quantity of 1 can be selected from the products lookup with the 'burger' or '3 horizontal lines' icon whilst in quote.</p>
<p>Multiple items can be deleted under the options button with 'Delete Item'.</p>
<p>Company details are divided into public and private. The profile table is intended for multiple profiles especially when email addresses, and mobile numbers change.</p>
<p>If a Tax -Rate is set to default, it will be used on all new quotes and invoices. ie. A Quote Tax Rate will be created from this Tax Rate automatically and will be created and used on all new quotes. The same will apply to all invoices.</p>
<p>If you want to create a quote or an invoice group, specific to a client, use the Setting...Group feature to setup a Group identifier eg. JOE for the  JOE Ltd Company. The next id will be appended to JOE ie. JOE001.</p>
<p>Products and Tasks can be entered separately on an invoice and are mutually exclusive so if you enter a task you cannot enter a product at the same time.</p>
<b>Deprecated Original Features</b>
<p>Themes will be introduced at a later date.</p>
<p>It is not intended to deprecate any of the features currently in InvoicePlane.</p>
<b>Proposed Features</b>
<p>Upgrading the forms to include the demo's php or server based form structure.</p>
<p>An interlinked basic bookkeeping system to audit transactions and produce an audit trail of invoices and payments</p>
<b>Security</b>
<p>All Entity properties initialized before the construct should be private. The private property is accessed through a public getter method as built below the construct.</p>
<b>Reasons for using a simplified <code>id</code> as a primary key in all the tables</b>
<p>See <a href="https://cycle-orm.dev/docs/annotated-relations/1.x/en#belongsto">{relationName}_{outerKey}</a>, the outerKey being the primary key, structure. 
    Eg. the field <code>tax_rate_id</code> in the Product table is a relation or a foreign key in the Product table equal and pointing to its parent table's Tax Rate's <code>id</code>  
    so the relation name <b>variable</b> in Entity: Product must be <code>$tax_rate</code> and joined with the outerKey as <code>$id</code> you get <code>$tax_rate_id</code> which matches the foreign key <code>$tax_rate_id</code> in Entity: Product
    If the primary key in the Tax Rate table was named something like tax_rate_id and not id then the relation could not be given a name.
</p>
<b>Future Work</b>
<p>Psalm static testing and removing of INFO suggestions.</p>
<p>Yiisoft's Mailer function incorporated using adminEmail as default config param for userinv->email.</p>
<p>A new feature of product custom fields has to be developed.</p>
<p>Client Custom Fields dependency on client_custom_fields.js will be removed as has been done for Payment Custom Fields. </p>
<p>Redundant functions generated by the Generator have to be deleted.</p>
<b>Work in progress</b>
<p>The client/view has been developed but the index under the Client View has to be rebuilt using the code similar to the new Invoice index.</p>
<p>The dashboard is being developed with Sumex still to be incorporated.</p>
<p>All the settings in the setting view,  still have to be linked to their specific purpose by consulting with the Original Invoiceplane code. Progress on this has been made especially with the Email tab.</p>
<p>All forms have to be modified from Html to Yii3's php based form structure.
<p>Email Template</p>
<p>User custom fields have to be developed.</p>
<p>Accessing a quote using the url_key in the browser is possible now by a customer. The url_key is retrieved at the bottom of the  quote by admin and pasted into an email. Login as a user who has the observer role with user_id 7, (after the 6 dummy users in demo) to test the customer's login ability. The customer can be sent the url_key (instead of the actual quote) by email. The user can then accept or reject the quote online using this url_key. This quote can then be copied to an invoice by the administrator if accepted by the customer.</p>
