# PaymentInformationController.php Overview

`PaymentInformationController.php` is the central hub for handling all online payments for invoices in the application.  
It serves as a complex bridge between the application and various third-party payment gateways, ensuring payments are processed securely and in a PCI-compliant manner.

---

## Core Purpose

The main goal of this controller is to present customers with a payment form for a specific invoice, tailored to their chosen payment gateway.  
It manages the entire payment lifecycle: from initiating transactions with gateways, handling callbacks, and updating invoice statuses.

---

## Supported Gateways

This controller integrates with a wide range of payment providers:
- **Stripe** (credit/debit cards)
- **Mollie** (various European payment methods)
- **Braintree** (a PayPal service)
- **Amazon Pay**
- **Open Banking** (providers like Wonderful, Tink, and other OAuth2-based providers)

---

## Key Routes and Methods

### 1. `inform(gateway, url_key)`
- The main entry point when a user clicks a "Pay Now" link for an invoice.
- Accepts the gateway name (e.g., 'Stripe') and the invoice's unique `url_key`.
- Loads invoice data, checks payment status, and routes the request to the correct payment gateway handler.

### 2. `pciCompliantGatewayInForms(...)`
- Acts as a router, delegating requests to the appropriate gateway-specific form method (e.g., `stripeInForm`, `mollieInForm`).

### 3. **Gateway-Specific Form Methods (`...InForm`)**
- **`stripeInForm(...)`**:  
  Communicates with Stripe API to create a PaymentIntent, passing the client_secret and publishableKey to the view. Stripe.js handles card input, ensuring PCI compliance.
- **`mollieInForm(...)`**:  
  Creates a payment request via Mollie API, obtains a checkout URL, and renders a page directing the user to Mollie's secure site.
- **`braintreeInForm(...)`**:  
  Generates a client token, renders a Drop-in UI, and processes the payment nonce directly from the Braintree UI.
- **`amazonInForm(...)`**:  
  Prepares data and signatures for the Amazon Pay button and renders the view.
- **`openBankingInForm(...)`**:  
  Determines the specific provider (e.g., Wonderful, Tink), and prepares the authentication URL/token for bank transfer initiation.

### 4. **Completion Callback Methods (`..._complete`)**
- Redirect targets after the user completes payment on the third-party site.
- Each method (e.g., `stripe_complete`, `mollie_complete`) verifies payment status with its gateway and, on success, calls `record_online_payments_and_merchant`.

---

## Helper Methods

- **`record_online_payments_and_merchant(...)`**:  
  - Creates a new Payment record, linking it to the invoice and updating the balance.
  - Logs the transaction in a Merchant record, including reference numbers and status messages.

- **Logo Rendering Methods**:  
  Render logos for the company and payment providers to improve the payment experience.
